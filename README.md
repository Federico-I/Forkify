# Forkify Project
This application was coded along along wiht the course I was taking to learn JavaScript ES6. The project is a recepie application and it works on the forntend, it means that the data that is being displayed on the app is stored on the client side. One of the main functionalities is for the user to be able to customize a recipie, store it in the app and bookmarked it, so it will be posible to come back to it later.
